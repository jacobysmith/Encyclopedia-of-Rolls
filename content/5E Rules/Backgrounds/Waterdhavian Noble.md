## Waterdhavian Noble

- **Skill Proficiencies:** History, Persuasion
- **Languages:** Any one of your choice
- **Tool Proficiencies:** One type of gaming set or musical instrument
- **Equipment:** A set of *fine clothes*, a *signet ring* or brooch, a scroll of pedigree, a skin of fine zzar or wine, and a purse containing 20 gp

#### Feature: Kept in Style

While you are in Waterdeep or elsewhere in the North, your house sees to your everyday needs. Your name and signet are sufficient to cover most of your expenses; the inns, taverns, and festhalls you frequent are glad to record your debt and send an accounting to your family's estate in Waterdeep to settle what you owe.

This advantage enables you to live a comfortable lifestyle without having to pay 2 gp a day for it, or reduces the cost of a wealthy or aristocratic lifestyle by that amount. You may not maintain a less affluent lifestyle and use the difference as incomeâ€”the benefit is a line of credit, not an actual monetary reward.

#### Suggested Characteristics

Use the tables for the [[noble]] background in the Player's Handbook as the basis for your traits and motivations, modifying the entries when appropriate to suit your identity as a member of a Waterdhavian family.

Like other nobles, you were born and raised in a different world from the one that most folk know - one that grants you privilege but also calls you to fulfill a duty befitting your station. Your bond might be associated with your family alone, or it could be concerned with another noble house that sides with or opposes your own. Your ideal depends to some extent on how you view your role in the family, and how you intend to conduct yourself in the world at large as a representative of your house.
